In the middle ages, the truth was definen by either what the pope or what the king said. <br>
There was no point in arguing, if you had interest in continuing your life.

                        This changed at around 1500, when byzantium fell, and its knowledge (mostly in form of books) reached central europe.<br>

They were not only discussing specific scientific phenomenas, but also bigger, philosophical things, like how ony could understand the world.

                    <h3>Early criticism</h3>
                    <p>
The distopia created by technology has been the topic of many books/tv-shows etc. For example Orwell created a book in 1948, which covered the upcoming problem of mass surveillance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This topic has since been critically looked at, for example in the famous tv-show "black mirror", which presents the disturbing idea of a social score system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The shocking truth is, that mass surveillance systems like those are not far from reality. China for example has been implementing a comparable system in the last few years.

During a Cholera outbreak in London, John Snow analyzed the pattern and clusters of the single cases.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
While no one knew how cholera was transmitted John was still able to find the source of the outbreak to be a contaminated waterpump.
                    </p>
                    <p>
His findins were rejected by the government out of political reasons: They did not want the public to fear from the oral-faecal transmission method.

                    <p>
A prominent example for scientific is the myth of Newton being hit by an apple on the head, which then lead to the discovery of gravity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
By saying "If i have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants", Newton pointed out, that new knowledge depends on previous findings. New knowledge thus is <b>not</b> created in context-free space.

A Hypothesis is a statement, which is a possible explanation of a phenomenon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
If you can not test a certain hypothesis it is not a "good" hypothesis. Only when one can proof/disproof a hypothesis it is a good scientific hypothesis.

A zero hypothesis states, that there is no causal connection between two variables. <br>
The goal of a study then is, to disproof that zero hypothesis.

                        The term zero hypothesis is also often used in inference-statistics,
                        when performing for example a two-sample t-test, which can check the possibility of that zero hypothesis being true.

                    <h3> Falsifiability </h3>

Karl Popper stated, that a Theory can not be proven, but only disproven.

                    <p>
                      This really well combines with the zero hypothesis, since using the concept of falsifiybility, you do not try to prove the hypothesis you think is true, but rather disprove its opposite.

A relationship between two variables does not automatically mean, that there is a causal connection between that two variables. <br>
This could just as well be a coincidence, or both be the result of something else (for example: the world population rises, death rise, more people have glasses. The conclusion that people die because of glasses is still not proven).
